# Development
- only use LESS on layout/page styles (reset.css and fonts.css shouldn't change)
- reset.css
- fonts.css
- inline critical CSS
- async loading of non-critical CSS
- preset color theme
- use ninja wug for favicon
- only use inline JS in client (use Babel to insert this during build)
- cache assets
- support mobile
- slideout menu on mobile
- use CosmosDB attachments for file uploads
- use better naming scheme for file uploads
- Express
  - trust proxy
  - .hbs extension
  - helmet
  - public directory

# Admin
- no separate admin nav page (for now)
- CV admin page is a list of links to each type of CV item
- each link takes you to a static form page, which submits to server
- all logic for admin pages is server-side (no JS on client)
- use Azure's turnkey solution rather than Passport

# Testing
- Google Chrome
- Microsoft Edge
- Mozilla Firefox
