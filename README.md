# Printing
* Use Prince PDF
* Turn off JavaScript (uncheck `Enable Document Scripts`)
* Remove Prince logo from PDF (using Adobe Acrobat Pro)
* Prince does not currently support the following (as of v11.3), meaning that you need to include fallback CSS in your print media styles:
  - flexbox
  - CSS variables
